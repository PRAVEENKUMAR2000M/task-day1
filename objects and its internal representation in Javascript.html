        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>in JavaScript</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                One of the most significant data types in JavaScript are objects. They
                are used to represent real-world objects like people, automobiles, and
                houses. Additionally, they can be used to represent ideas that are
                more ethereal, such as games, websites, and databases.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, an object is a group of properties. There are names and
                values for each property. The value can be any JavaScript data type,
                including a string, number, boolean, object, or function. The name is
                a string.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Using the object literal syntax or the
                <code>Object()</code> constructor function, objects can be
                constructed. A more condensed method of constructing objects is the
                object literal syntax. It enables you to define the properties and
                their values without calling the <code>Object()</code>
                constructor function.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, a hash table serves as an object's internal
                representation. A data structure that associates keys with values is a
                hash table. The values are the property values, while the keys are the
                names of the properties. To easily look for properties by name,
                utilize the hash table.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="codeSnip">
            <pre>
    <code>
let myObject = {
name: "praveenkumar",
age: 24,
city: "salem"
};
            </code>
            
        </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                <code>myObject</code> has three properties: name, age, and city.
                "praveenkumar" is the string value for the name property, 24 is the number
                value for the age property, and "salem" is the string value for the
                city property.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The dot notation can be used to retrieve an object's property. For
                instance, you could use the following code to retrieve the name
                property's value
            </p>

            <pre>
        <code>
let name = myObject.name;
Console.log(name); //output: praveenkumar
        </code>
    </pre>

            <p>The name variable will now have the string value "praveenkumar" in it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The bracket notation can also be used to retrieve an object's
                properties. When the property name is a string that contains spaces or
                other special characters, the bracket notation is helpful. For
                instance, you would enter the following code to determine the value of
                city property:
            </p>
        </div>

        <pre>
    <code>
let city = myObject[“city”];
Console.log(city); //output: salem    
    </code>
</pre>

        <div>
            <p>The city variable will now have the string value "salem" in it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                he <code>Object()</code> constructor function can be used to generate
                objects in the following ways:
            </p>
        </div>
        <pre>
    <code>
let myObject = new Object ();

myObject.name = "praveenkumar";
myObject.age = 24;
myObject.city = "salem";      
    </code>
</pre>

        <div>
            <p>
                <code>myObject</code> is now constructed and has the same
                characteristics as the object created using the object literal syntax.
                Objects can also have methods. An object's associated function is
                known as a method. Actions on an object are carried out via methods.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The function keyword is used to specify methods. The method name, the
                list of parameters, and the method body are placed after the function
                keyword. The list of variables provided to the method when it is
                called is known as the parameter list. When a method is called, a
                block of code called the body of the method is run.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                An example of a method defined for the <code>myObject</code> object is
                as follows:
            </p>
        </div>
        <pre>
    <code>
let myObject = {
name: "praveenkumar",
age: 24,
city: "salem",
greeting: function () {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
    }
};         
    const greeting = myObject.greeting();
    console.log(greeting); //output: Hello, my name is praveenkumar        
    </code>
</pre>
        <div>
            <p>
                <code>myObject</code>'s <code>greeting ()</code> method is defined.
                There are no parameters required and a string is returned by the
                <code>greeting ()</code> method.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Objects are a powerful data structure in JavaScript. They can be used
                to represent real-world objects, such as people, cars, and houses.
                They can also be used to represent more abstract concepts, such as
                games, websites, and databases.
                <br />
                Here are some of the benefits of using objects in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects are a powerful way to organize data.</li>
                <li>Objects can be used to represent real-world objects.</li>
                <li>Objects can be used to represent more abstract concepts.</li>
                <li>Objects are easy to use.</li>
                <li>Objects are efficient.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To sum up, JavaScript objects are an effective tool for manipulating
                and storing data. Properties, which are key-value pairs, make up
                objects. The data that is kept in the property is the value, and the
                key is a string that identifies the property. Any type of property is
                permissible, including strings, numbers, objects, and functions.
