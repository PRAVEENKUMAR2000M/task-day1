                The World Wide Web's primary protocol is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
                Protocol). It outlines the format and transmission of messages between
                web servers and browsers. The protocol has existed for more than 20
                years, with HTTP 1.1 being the most recent version. It is therefore
                beginning to look older.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP 2 is the next generation of the HTTP protocol. It was created to
                alleviate some of the drawbacks of HTTP 1.1, including its
                inefficiency and the absence of support for some functionality.

            <p>
                HTTP 1.1:- HTTP/1.1 is a stateless protocol. As a result, every
                request a client sends to a server is distinct from any others that
                have come before. As a result, the server must send the same headers
                and other data with each request, which might be inefficient. A
                connection-oriented method of data transfer is also used by HTTP 1.1.
                This indicates that each request generates a unique TCP connection. As
                a result, there may be bottlenecks because the server can only manage
                so many connections at once.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Connection-Oriented: The HTTP 1.1 protocol is a connection-oriented
                    protocol. This indicates that each request generates a unique TCP
                    connection. Because the server can only manage a limited number of
                    concurrent connections, this can lead to bottlenecks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Header Compression: HTTP 1.1 enables header compression, which can
                    help to minimize the size of HTTP headers. The amount of data that
                    needs to be sent across the network can be decreased, which can
                    enhance performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pipelining: Multiple requests may be made to the server using the
                    pipelining feature of HTTP 1.1 before the server must respond to any
                    of them. This can increase performance by minimising the amount of
                    time the client must wait for the server to respond to each request.
                </li>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                HTTP 2:- HTTP 2 is a stateful protocol. As a result, the server is
                able to monitor the status of the client and server connections.
                Performance may be enhanced by allowing the server to provide
                resources that the client has previously requested. The multiplexing
                method of data transport is also used by HTTP 2. As a result, more
                than one request can be transmitted over a single TCP connection. By
                limiting the number of connections the server must manage, this can
                enhance performance.
            </p>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Binary Protocol : Text directives are processed by HTTP1.1 to
                    complete request-response cycles. To carry out the identical
                    operations, HTTP/2 will employ binary commands (in 1s and 0s). Due
                    to commands comprising text and optional spaces, framing issues are
                    made easier to handle, and the implementation of commands that were
                    confusingly combined together is made simpler.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiplexing: Multiplexing is a feature of HTTP 2 that enables the
                    transmission of several requests over a single TCP connection.
                    Because there would be fewer connections for the server to manage,
                    performance may be improved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Header Compression: In comparison to HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2 has a more
                    effective header compression method. By lowering the volume of data
                    that needs to be transferred over the network, this can further
                    improve performance. HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method
                    called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header
                    packets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server Push: With the help of server push in HTTP 2, resources can
                    be sent to clients before they are requested. By cutting down on the
                    length of time the client has to wait for the server to respond to
                    each request, this can enhance performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Connection reuse: The client and server can use the same connection
                    for a number of queries with HTTP 2. As a result, the time it takes
                    to create a new connection will be less, which will increase
                    performance.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 has a variety of benefits, including:</p>
            <p>
                Enhanced performance: Thanks to its support for multiplexing, header
                compression, server push, and connection efficiency, HTTP/2 is much
                quicker than HTTP/1.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reduced latency: By transmitting several requests and responses over a
                single TCP connection, HTTP/2 can minimise latency. This can enhance
                the user experience by accelerating the loading of web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enhanced reliability: Thanks to its more advanced header compression
                mechanism, HTTP/2 is more dependable than HTTP/1.1. This may assist in
                lowering the frequency of data transfer errors.
